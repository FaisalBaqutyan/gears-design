designing 4 gears with a gear ratio of 1/18


i designed 4 spur gears with a gear ratio of 1/18, I started by choosing two simple ratios in which their multiplication is equal to 1/18

the two ratios are 1/3 and 1/6 then I choose the number of teeth based on the gear ratio 

For the first stage with a ratio of 1/6 i choose T1 = 12, and T2 = 72

For the second stage with a ratio of 1/3 i choose T3 = 10, and T4 = 30
